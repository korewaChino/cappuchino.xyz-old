I go on the internet as Cappy Ishihara. I'm a high school student studying an English major at the Srinakharinwirot University (Demonstration School).

For privacy reasons, I will not be sharing my real name.

I speak fluent English and Thai, and I am a native Thai speaker.

I have experience in the following areas:

-Software development

-Music production

-Package maintainance

I am the founder of the Ultramarine Linux project, and I used to be the project maintainer for it. I also work on the Virtual Puppet Project (see below).

I'm interested in the software development community, and my projects are open source.
